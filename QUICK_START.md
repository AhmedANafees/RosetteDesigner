## ✏️ Customize Your URL

After deployment, you can customize your URL:

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"** → **"Domains"**
3. Click **"Edit"** next to your `*.vercel.app` domain
4. Change it to something like:
   - `rosette-designer.vercel.app`
   - `guilloche-patterns.vercel.app`
   - `ornamental-turning.vercel.app`

---

## 🎨 Customize the Website

Want to change colors, add your name, or modify anything?

1. Open `index.html` in any text editor
2. Make your changes
3. Save the file
4. Re-deploy (drag & drop again, or push to GitHub)

### Quick Customizations:

**Change the title:**
Find line ~10: `<title>Rose Engine Rosette Designer</title>`

**Change colors:**
Find the `<style>` section and look for color values like:
- `#667eea` (purple)
- `#764ba2` (darker purple)
- `#e74c3c` (red)

**Add your name:**
Find the footer section and add your name

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Site shows 404"**
→ Make sure your file is named `index.html` (not `rosette-designer.html`)

**"Deployment failed"**
→ This shouldn't happen with a simple HTML file. Try re-uploading.

**"Can't see my changes"**
→ Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

**"How do I update my site?"**
→ If deployed via GitHub: edit on GitHub and commit
→ If deployed directly: run `vercel` again or drag & drop again
